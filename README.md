#### under submission at Neurips 2021.

0. The raw data is stored in ../TransportationNetworks-master/. The name of the networks corresponding to the name of the subfolders.

1. To generate a new instance, use the Passing_data_to_gpickle.ipynb. The new instance, after generated, is stored to ./data/
 
2. To re-run the experiments, use Main experiments.ipynb (by loading the instance that was generated by Passing_data_to_gpickle.ipynb). The results of the experiments are stored in ./solutions/

3. To plot out the results, use Plotting.ipynb.
